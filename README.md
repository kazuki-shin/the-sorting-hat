# The Sorting Hat from Harry Potter Series

This project trains a LSTM recurrent neural network model to classify users 
into different houses from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft using latent semantic 
analysis of character speech.

Use of tranfer learning: pretrained Word2Vec models produced word embedding, 
allowing measuring of vector distances between speaking patterns and corresponding 
Harry Potter houses.
